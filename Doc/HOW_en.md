[For English](https://github.com/TinekeFrineke/PeopleSkills/Doc/HOW_en)

Think of an application like "Choices". It is a game for your mobile, where you choose a character and go through a story.
The story is in principle linear, but by making choices you influence the story:
who will be your friends, what are you good at etc.

There are some challenges: Technology, graphics and content. And, of course, other obstacles.

### Technical: Ren'Py
There is an engine with which you can easily create interactive books:
[Ren'Py] (http://www.renpy.org). The software is open source and many games have already been made for it, most of them in manga style. On the page
[https://games.renpy.org/[(https://games.renpy.org/) you can see examples of games created with Ren'Py and what they look like.

Basically, each screen consists of a background, a character and text. You can have a character with multiple facial expressions,
and the text can also be a choice text, think of:

__Tonight I'm going:__
* to bed early
* out with my friends
* to chill with my girlfriend

You can earn game points in many ways, for example by impressing people, or being nice to people,
be ad brake depending on what you want to achieve.

I think this is a good option. Some things have to be sorted out:
for example, the engine supports Android, but you have to do something special for that.

### Graphic
That's a tricky one. I've seen edited photos as backgrounds. But I think the characters are a challenge.
Especially if you want to have a bit of relaxt facial expressions.

### Content
Basically you could make a game from the statement "I want ...":
* I want to make friends
* I want a friend
* I want another job

But also things like:
* I want to become a movie star
* I want to become president
* I want to become a pirate

These are things that have elements that are difficult for people with autism.

The gameplay is also part of this: in practice you want to see something when someone else thinks you say something sweet, for example
or just something bulky. And the player may also be able to ask for an explanation when something has consequences that he / she does not understand.

### Other obstacles
__1. Attractive to girls__
These "social" games are traditionally played by girls. We need to do something extra to make it attractive to boys too, maybe:
- A different kind of (fighting / racing) games
- Put the goal first: "Do you want to learn ... then:"

__2. Generalizing from a concrete situation__
It is often difficult for people with autism to see the similarities in situations that are similar but not the same.
