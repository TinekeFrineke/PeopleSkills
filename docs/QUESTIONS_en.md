# Questions
## 1. Show only head or whole body?
Space is limited on your mobile, but if you take a small picture you cannot do anything with body language
## 2. Support English or Dutch or multiple languages?
For 14+, English is not a problem, but it might be wise to already have multiple language support available.
## 3. Realistic or sketchy
For small children, a doll with an unfinished face (e.g. only two buttons as eyes) leaves more room for its own interpretation. How's this for people with autism?
