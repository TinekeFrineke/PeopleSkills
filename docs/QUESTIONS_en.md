## What is the product?
It would be ideal if others could provide material for stories that can then be easily published. Now it seems that you have to rely on either something like Ren'Py or Unity, which is very laborious, you really have to "code", or a paid product like Visual Novel maker.

Is the product a "wrapper" that allows you to generate these stories from source material in a prescribed format? Or is the product the stories that are made with it?
## Only show head or whole body?
Space is limited on your mobile, but if you display a small picture you can't do anything with body language
## Support English or Dutch or multiple languages?
For 14+, English is not a problem, but it might be wise to already have multiple language support available.
## Realistic or fantasy story
Maybe this doesn't matter at all, it could be both, side by side. The only question is whether one works better than the other.
## Realistic or sketchy
For small children, a doll with an unfinished face (e.g. only two buttons as eyes) leaves more room for its own interpretation. How's this for people with autism?
