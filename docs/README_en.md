Gamification of learning of favourable behaviour in a social context.

```
>> I knew the queen was competitive.
   I saw that I could win with one stroke. I:
   1. missed on purpose and let her win
   2. hit the ball with a firm blow through the gate. <<

## Can a game help people learn to deal with social challenges?

### How?
I am thinking of an interactive story. Storytelling teaches us that a story teaches us more than a summary of the facts.
An interactive story makes it possible to experience situations "real" and to experience the consequences of actions.

### Why?
It would be nice if you can calmly investigate social situations. As an autist you do not immediately understand it. And many people with autism do not immediately see what their own behavior evokes in another.

### Is it fun?
Potentially, a game challenges the player to learn new things. The skills you achieve are skills apt foor the game you play.
The vastness of the game community shows that a lot of people voluntarily spend many hours on this type of learning. So, yes.

### Does it fit every target audience?
For now, the primary targeted audience is adolescent between 15 and 18 years of age. I hope this can be extended in the future to addres grownups too.
