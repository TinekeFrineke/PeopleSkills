# Why?
[Nederlands](WHY_nl) / [Main menu](README_en) 
When you, as a person with autism, run into a problem, you can, for example, read a book, take a course or find a therapist. Or play a game on your mobile!

## Easily accessible
A game is easily accessible. You can play it whenever you want.

## Autonomy
It would be nice if you can calmly investigate social situations. As an autist you do not immediately understand it. And many people with autism do not immediately see what their own behavior evokes in another.

If it is a good game, you are in full control. A game can give instant feedback, and when you have a reward system with "tokens", visual "things" (eg plus, thumb, etc.) this is also a kind of "buzz". But you still decide if and when you play and how you behave.

A game could also explain why certain things work or not, as well as whether everyone responds the same to certain behavior.

## Experiential learning
Because you act in a game yourself and "experience" the consequences, it is actually experiential learning, whether or not combined with explanation and thus understanding. A powerful combination!
