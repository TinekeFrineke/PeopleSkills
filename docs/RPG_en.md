## RPG
Ever since I became a programmer, I see interactive learning as a great possibility. But most educational software comes in the form of: statement - answer - check. That is boring.

I am a regular gamer myself, and have mainly played RPGs. An RPG is a game where you are a person or a group of persons in a game with a mission: save the kingdom / free the prince / find the treasure. To overcome the challenges that come your way, you need to develop your character or group.

This potentially challenges learning. Depending on the type of RPG, you will fight, negotiate, do magic, steal, etc. in order to be adept at doing the big job. The skills you learn are skills specific to THIS game. In my mind I already saw myself participating in a Roman battle as part of the history lesson.

The size of the game community shows that many people voluntarily spend many hours with this type of learning. But an RPG like the ones made in the gamers world is a lot of work.
## Visual Novel
My daughter pointed out a new type of games, the visual novel.
